# MD&A_Panel_Data_Regression
In this project which is a part of one of my classmate master's thesis, I extracted Management Discussion Analysis (MD&A) documents from 10K SEC Fillings pdf files of major canadian companies in text format and by deploying NLP I quantitatively calculated the yearly change in each company MD&A reports from 2016 to 2021. Then using other variables obtained from Datastream and CFMRC data sources for each company, I applied cross sectional regression and fixed effects regression techniques to study investors and analysts reactions to MD&A disclosure.
This project was coded in Colab.
